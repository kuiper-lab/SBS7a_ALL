# Scripts to analyse mutational signature SBS7a in BCP-ALL
The code in this repository was used for the study "UV-induced mutations accumulate during early clonal expansion in aneuploid subtypes of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia".
Code is provided per figure or table.

## Figure 1
This directory contains code for the generation of mutation matrices and extraction of mutational signatures. It also contains code for the visualizations in figure 1.

## Figure 2
This directory contains code for the calculation and visualization of tumor mutational load, number of CC>TT mutations and transcriptional strand bias.

## Figure 3
This directory contains code to plot karyotypes, compare prognosis based on karyotype, and study copy number alterations of chromosome 21 in more detail.

## Figure 4
This directory contains code to identify subclonal mutations and extract mutational signatures from these mutations. These scripts are also used for the generation of supplementary figures S4 and S5.

## Figure 5
This directory contains code to study acquired mutations, analyse deep sequencing data and generate fishplots.

## Figure 6
This directory contains code to analyse single-cell whole genome sequencing data and generate the lineage tree for patient P0624. These scripts are also used for the generation of supplementary figures S6 and S7.

## Figure S1
This directory contains code to analyse and visualize the expression of genes in the nucleotide excision repair pathway.

## Figure S2
This directory contains code to perform differential expression analysis and generate volcano plots.

## Figure S3
This directory contains code to study the timing of SBS7a compared to amplifications of chromosome 21.

## Figure S6
This directory contains code to analyse single-cell whole genome sequencing data and generate the lineage tree for patient P0625. This script is also used for the generation of supplementary figure  S7.

## Table 1
This directory contains code to study the presence of SBS7a in a pan-cancer cohort.

## Tabe S3
This directory contains code to extract mutations in the nucleotide excision repair pathway from whole genome sequencing data.
