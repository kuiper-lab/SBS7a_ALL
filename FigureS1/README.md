# Figure S1 
This directory contains code to make a heatmap of genes in the NER KEGG pathway (list of genes can be found in directory TableS3). Reads generated by RNA sequencing were mapped to GRCh38 (gencode version 31) using STAR v2.7.2d4, after which count matrices were generated with Rsubread v1.6.45. 

## MakeNERHeatmap.R
This script uses count matrices to generate heatmaps of the NER pathway.
