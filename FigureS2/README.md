# Supplementary Figure S2
This directory contains code to perform differential expression analysis and generate volcano plots. Reads generated by RNA sequencing were mapped to GRCh38 (gencode version 31) using STAR v2.7.2d4, after which count matrices were generated with Rsubread v1.6.45.

## DEanalysis.R
This script can be used to perform a differential expression analysis between SBS7a-positive and SBS7a-negative samples within one subtype based on the generated count matrices. It generates volcano plots (Supplementary Figure S2A-B,D-F).

## DEgenesOverlap.R
This script can be used to find overlap in differentially expressed genes between datasets, which were found with DEanalysis.R. It generates Venn diagrams (Supplementary Figure S2C,G).
